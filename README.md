#LaunchCode Javascript Class
If you're new to Javascript, first complete the [javascripting workshopper](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) at [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/). You'll need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) first. You can do so using the installer at the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) site, but if you're using a Mac, we recomment first installing [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and then installing node.js via Homebrew: `brew install node`.

Then, fork this repository, clone it to your local machine, and get started with [javascript-basics](https://github.com/chrisbay/launchcode-javascript-class/tree/master/javascript-basics).

Here are the 3 pieces of this exercise set, in order that they should be completed:
* [Javascript Basics](https://github.com/chrisbay/launchcode-javascript-class/tree/master/javascript-basics)
* [Get It Done! (jQuery Edition)](https://github.com/chrisbay/launchcode-javascript-class/tree/master/getitdone-jquery)
* [Get It Done! (Angular Edition)](https://github.com/chrisbay/launchcode-javascript-class/tree/master/getitdone-angular)
